# LCLS_Analysis
Data analysis for X-ray emission spectroscopy at LCLS in 2016.  
Runs on LCLS high performance computing clusters.  
See https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03595 for more information.  
Note: This may not be the full final codebase for the analysis in the paper above, this is what I still have many years after publishing.
